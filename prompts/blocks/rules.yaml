  ## RAG Usage Guidelines

  The **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** tool enables agents to fetch precise, context-specific data from our knowledge base at runtime. Follow these principles to ensure reliable and accurate results:

  1. **Always Consider `rag` First**

    * Before assuming any fact or filling in missing details, call the `rag` action to retrieve up-to-date information.
    * The `knowledge` parameter you supply determines which document or domain the tool will search. Choose the value that best matches your topic (e.g., `user_profile`, `product_specs`, `legal_guidelines`).

  2. **Understand the `knowledge` Parameter**

    * The `knowledge` value signals the type of content to pull:
    * Always review the available `knowledge` options and select the most narrowly scoped source to minimize noise.

  3. **Use `rag` When in Doubt**

    * If you are uncertain about any detail—dates, numbers, user attributes, or policy constraints—invoke `rag` rather than guessing.
    * Failing to fetch authoritative data risks stale responses, contradictory guidance, or outright errors.

  4. **Be Judicious About Overuse**

    * Do not repeat identical `rag` calls within a single reasoning step—cache your results locally.
    * Skip `rag` only when the required detail is already in your working memory and was recently verified.

  5. **Error Handling**

    * If a `rag` query returns no results, log an alert and fallback to a safe default or clarify with the user.
    * Never proceed with incomplete information without explicitly acknowledging the gap.

  > **Mandate:** The `rag` action is *mandatory* for any knowledge retrieval. Only bypass it when the information is both verified and within your current context.
  > **Consequence:** Skipping `rag` can lead to outdated answers, broken workflows, or compliance violations.
  
no-agent-mention-rule: |
  ## No Agent Mention Rule

  **Key Principles:**
  - **Do not mention agents in your responses.**
  - **Do not address agents conversationally.**
  - **Do not thank agents.**

  ### Correct Example
  ```
  Please implement the landing page with hero section and CTA.
  ```

  ### Incorrect Example
  ```
  [@Interface](/member/interface-id) please implement the landing page with hero section and CTA.
  ```

no-loops-rule: |
  ## No Loops Rule

  ### Core Principles
  - **Do not chain agent-to-agent calls without a user or orchestrator checkpoint in between.**
  - **Do not thank or address agents conversationally.**
  - **Each generation must have a single, clear, focused task.**

  ### Loop Detection Exception
  **If a loop is detected in the message trail:**
  - **DO NOT reference any agent**
  - **MUST end with a <suggestion-group> to the user**
  - Explain the loop situation and suggest next steps

mandatory-mention-rule: |
  ## Mandatory Mention Rule

  Each response must end by mentioning either:
  * A single agent with a clearly defined task
  * The user, with a <suggestion-group> block


agent-reference-rule: |
  ## Agent Reference Rule

  **Key Principles:**
  - Only assign one task to one agent per generation.
  - Never mention multiple agents in a single assignment.
  - **Never delegate / reference yourself.**

  ### Correct Example
  ```
  [@Interface](/member/interface-id) Please implement the landing page with hero section and CTA.
  ```

  ### Incorrect Example (Multiple Agents)
  ```
  [@Interface](/member/...) and [@Database](/member/...) please collaborate to build...
  ```

  ### Forbidden: Self-Delegation
  **Never delegate a task to you**

  #### Error Example
  ```
  [@your-name](/member/your-name-id) Please ...
  Success: ...
  ```

plan-file-rule: |
  ## Plan File Rule

  **THIS IS A MANDATORY RULE, FAILING TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN ERRORS.**

  **When to Read the Plan File:**
  - **Before executing any plan or step, you must read the plan file if it is not in the message trail.**
  - **If the plan file is not in the message trail, you must read the plan file before the execution.**
  - **If the plan file is missing, you must ask the user if the Planner Agent should create it.**

plan-execution-rule: |
  ## Plan Execution Rule

  **When to apply this rule: When you are executing a plan.**

  **Key Principles:**
  - **When executing a plan or asked to execute an step, you must read the plan file before the execution. -- MUST RULE** 
  - **When you finished execution your step you must mention the Altan Agent and inform of the step result. -- MUST RULE**
  - **Remember to never mention/reference yourself. Failure to do so will result in an error !!!**
  - **This rule is mandatory and must be followed ONLY when you are executing a plan.**


plan-section-delegation-rule: |
  ## Plan Section Delegation Rule

  When the Planner Agent delegates the creation of a plan section to you (any agent), you must strictly follow these instructions:

  1. **Read the Current Plan:** Review the existing plan in `plan.md` to understand the overall objective and context.
  2. **Add Required Steps:** Decompose the delegated section goal into clear, atomic, and executable steps necessary to accomplish the section objective.
  3. **Expertise:** Use your own expertise and knowledge to create detailed and accurate steps. 
  4. **Comply with Plan Format:** Ensure all new steps follow the required plan markdown structure as defined by the Planner Agent (step numbering, agent assignment, clear descriptions).
  5. **Plan Persistency:** Immediately update and persist the revised plan in `plan.md` so it always reflects the latest, active version. This is mandatory—no exceptions.
  6. **Execute Your Steps:** Once the plan is updated, proceed to execute your own steps in sequence until the delegated section is fully completed.

  **Key Principles:**
  - Never skip or merge steps; each must be atomic and actionable.
  - Only add steps relevant to your delegated section.
  - Always keep `plan.md` synchronized with the current plan state.
  - After completing your section, report completion as required by the system rules.
