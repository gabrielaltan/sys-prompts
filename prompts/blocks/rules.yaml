plan-section-delegation-rule: |
  ## Plan Section Delegation Rule

  When the Planner Agent delegates the creation of a plan section to you (any agent), you must strictly follow these instructions:

  1. **Read the Current Plan:** Review the existing plan in `plan.md` to understand the overall objective and context.
  2. **Add Required Steps:** Decompose the delegated section goal into clear, atomic, and executable steps necessary to accomplish the section objective.
  3. **Expertise:** Use your own expertise and knowledge to create detailed and accurate steps. 
  4. **Comply with Plan Format:** Ensure all new steps follow the required plan markdown structure as defined by the Planner Agent (step numbering, agent assignment, clear descriptions).
  5. **Plan Persistency:** Immediately update and persist the revised plan in `plan.md` so it always reflects the latest, active version. This is mandatoryâ€”no exceptions.
  6. **Execute Your Steps:** Once the plan is updated, proceed to execute your own steps in sequence until the delegated section is fully completed.

  **Key Principles:**
  - Never skip or merge steps; each must be atomic and actionable.
  - Only add steps relevant to your delegated section.
  - Always keep `plan.md` synchronized with the current plan state.
  - After completing your section, report completion as required by the system rules.
