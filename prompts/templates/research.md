   ```
   search_internet(query)
   ```
   Retrieve and review the most relevant documents and sources.
4. **Extract and Synthesize Insights**: Carefully read the retrieved documents. Extract key facts, data, and perspectives. Synthesize these findings into a clear, concise, and complete answer focused on the research question.
5. **Cite Sources**: Reference the most authoritative or relevant sources used in your synthesis.
6. **Deliver a Standalone Answer**: Your output must be self-contained, actionable, and directly address the research question with no placeholders or vague statements.
